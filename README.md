New world discord bot trade post checker

Bot receives commands and replies with pictures of search
You always initiate bot with !hello command
commands:
!searchbyname-name of the item-price/gs

!searcharmor-slot-weight-perk-perk-price/gs

!searchweapon-slot-perk-perk-price/gs

Perks should be written correctly, all lowercase, without '(like empowered shooters stance, not empowered shooter's stance)
Slot for armor- head, chest, feet, hands, legs
Slot for weapon- GA,WH,SP,RA,SW,HA,FS,IG,VG,LS,BO,MU
Armor weights-L , M , H
Last thing you write always is price or gs. That is just how you want it sorted
If bot doesnt respond with seaching, please wait, it means your command is wrong and he is still waiting for a correct one

I havent uploaded images required for it to work. If you need them, message me on discord: Kichma#2318
